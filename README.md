THIS IS A WIP

# ðŸ¥”PuzzleScript

ðŸ¥”PuzzleScript is a markup language for building 3D puzzle games based on [PuzzleScript](https://github.com/increpare/PuzzleScript).

ðŸ¥”PuzzleScript is done in Haskell.

It's called ðŸ¥”PuzzleScript because ðŸ¥”s are 3D.


## Current State

Just started. Working on parsers.

## Roadmap

- finish parser to generate AST
- finish AST interpreter
- write C bindings
- do front end in Rust

## Features (planned)

- support full PuzzleScript markup language, with appropriate ðŸ¥” modifications where it makes sense
- design and implement ðŸ¥”PuzzleScript language capable of expressing mechanics of [Stephen's Sausage Roll](https://www.increpare.com/2016/04/stephens-sausage-roll/) and [English Country Tune](https://www.increpare.com/2011/11/english-country-tune/)
- level editor
