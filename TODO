DONE-expression parsers can read maps directly out of parsec state -__-
DONE-split out ExpressionParsers property tests into their own file
  IGNORE-just delete the bad unit tests in parsec_spec...
DONE-fix orientation abs/rel nonsense?
DONE-more unit tests
-remove Late modifier and add late rule section
-add + operator to rule expr (parse_RuleGroup)
  -figure out why the whitespace is necessary D:
  -add to Parsers.hs
-add late rule support
-switch non op character operators to use reserved instead of reservedOp
-add support for horizontal/vertical velocities
  -probably means adding boolean support to velocities (and figure out how to pattern match LHS/RHS)
  -should also support knownvelocities/orientations that are multiple velocities/orientations...
-add commands
  -late?
    -need to understand this better
  -cancel
  -win
  -message
  -again?
  -restart?
  -checkpoint?
-add input conditionals
  -engine interface
  DONE-vty hookups
-add support for boolean vars
-double check there are trys to all token parsers inside of <|> where needed
-add sounds
-potato math
  -do rot
  DONE-improve TR unit tests
-prelude
  -use_puzzle_script_player
    -assumes Player object and adds standard controls
  -use_relative_player

-add rigid and start/endLoop parsing to rules

DONE-fix parens issue, use expression parser or build your own
DONE-whats wrong with PT.identifier o__o
  -it was because of infinite loop in Arbitrary instance oops
