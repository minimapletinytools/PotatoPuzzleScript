-add + operator to rule expr (parse_RuleGroup)
  DONE-figure out why the whitespace is necessary D:
  -add to Parsers.hs
-add validation
  -pattern match validation
  -late rule validation
-add support for pattern -> pattern command (e.g.  [ > Player | Person ] -> [ < Player | Person ] message Woah, buddy, back off!)
-add input conditionals
  -engine interface
  DONE-vty hookups
-double check there are trys to all token parsers inside of <|> where needed
-potato math
  -do rot
  DONE-improve TR unit tests
-prelude
  -use_puzzle_script_player
    -assumes Player object and adds standard controls
  -use_relative_player
    -sausage roll movement
  -require_player_movement
-add support for boolean vars
-add sounds
-add rigid and start/endLoop parsing to rules
-add support for time based nonsense
  -again command
  -realtime_interval prelude

DONE/IGNORE-switch non op character operators to use reserved instead of reservedOp
DONE-figure out if reserved names are case sensitive or not
  -looks like it's not case sensitive
DONE-add commands
  -cancel
  -win
  -message
  IGNORE-again?
  IGNORE-restart?
  IGNORE-checkpoint?
DONE-remove support for coercing velocity/orientation to the other type
  -these are specified in the constants
DONE-remove case sensitivity I guess..
DONE-add knownDirections
DONE-add constants for orientation and velocities and directions
IGNORE-add boolean OR support for velocities/orientations
  DONE-allow specifying them in knownvelocities/orientations
  DONE-add support for horizontal/vertical velocities
  -not doing this anymore, it's done at the knownVelocitiy/Orientation/Direction level now.
IGNORE-do brackets test with the lexeme thing
  IGNORE-maybe also test out parens/brackets in expression parser. It really should fail...
DONE-rule parsing can't tell the difference between patterns and pattern followed by a new line
  -why is this even passing my unit tests?
DONE-expression parsers can read maps directly out of parsec state -__-
DONE-split out ExpressionParsers property tests into their own file
  IGNORE-just delete the bad unit tests in parsec_spec...
DONE-fix orientation abs/rel nonsense?
DONE-more unit tests
DONE-remove Late modifier and add late rule section
DONE-add late rule support
DONE-fix parens issue, use expression parser or build your own
DONE-whats wrong with PT.identifier o__o
  -it was because of infinite loop in Arbitrary instance oops
DONE-fixed rules:
  DONE-seems to parse an [] for some reason
  DONE-multi patterns can not span accross more than 1 line
